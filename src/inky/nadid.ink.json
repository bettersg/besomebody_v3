It was only when we both were assigned to a class project that I got to know the real him. And when I did, he surprised me. He was really earnest and genuine beneath that exterior, and he was a really sweet person. I never expected to like someone like Gavin, but by the end of the project, I had a full blown crush on him. And after that last class, when he told me he liked me... well, I felt like my heart was going to explode. We have been dating for about 2 years now, but in secret from most people. Gavin is a Chinese Christian, and I'm a Malay Muslim.",
