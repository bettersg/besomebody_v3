      "question": "How long do Muslims fast every day during the month of Ramadhan?",
      "correctAnswer": "Muslims fast from dawn to sunset",
      "explanation": "Sawm (fasting) begins with dawn and ends with sunset. Muslims rise before dawn, eat Suhoor (pre-dawn meal) and drink an adequate amount of liquids for the preparation of Sawm. Eating and drinking stops at dawn. During the day no eating or drinking is allowed. The fast is broken immediately after sunset usually by eating dates and drinking water or juice. However, any lawful food or drink may be used to break the fast. This is followed by the Maghrib Salah (after sunset prayer)",
