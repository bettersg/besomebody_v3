AMAN SINGH #title
Dear fans of ToBeYou.sg,
Over the past two weeks, we have received so much love from the community. Thousands of you have played it and shared such thoughtful and heart-felt responses to the game thus far. 
We have only released the initial chapters of two characters, and there’s much more to their stories, and many more characters on the way. I am excited for you to play them and to feel empathy for their journeys too.

However, there are some in the Sikh community who felt that the way in which one of our characters, Aman Singh, was presented was not respectful. They have given strong feedback to us and requested that we consider changing key parts of the story. 
We hear their concerns, and are in close consultation with the leaders of that community to address the issues. Allow us to also explain the philosophy behind the game and the way in which our stories are written.

ToBeYou's purpose is to share the experiences of different groups of Singaporeans, including the different experiences of people within a particular group. 
We hope that through exploring powerful identity dilemmas,  users will appreciate the complexity behind the choices others make, and engender empathy and goodwill for those around them. 

Firstly, our stories are written after substantial research. We do open source reading, we have an academic Research Advisor, and we hold multiple focus group discussions with members of the community. 
Our writers and editors are also closely connected to the community, and most are from those communities themselves. 
We do not put any value judgement on the choices that real people make, and we try to represent their dilemmas in our stories.

Secondly, our game is designed to explore different pathways that a person from that group may take. There are deliberately no right or wrong answers, no winning or losing outcomes, as in life. 
The pathways are deliberately designed to allow players to explore a variety of choices that shape the character, and mirror the diversity we see even within a community group. 
We do not favour or promote one pathway over the other. 
The choices that players make early in the game have consequences that will be played out in later chapters, and this is an important element of the story. Some of the choices that the character makes in the early chapters will have real and serious consequences later on. 
The objective of this is to let players experience those dilemmas first hand, and in the process, gain empathy for people who have a different identity, or have chosen pathways different from theirs.

// On the specific issue for Aman Singh’s story, there were some in the community who objected to the option of him not keeping his turban. During our interviews and focus group discussions, we heard stories from Sikh participants who struggled and sometimes eventually chose to cut their hair, for personal reasons. 
// The SAF does not require this, there are many who have kept their turbans and succeeded in NS, we understand what the Sikh faith says about this, and how strictly it is presented. 
// Nevertheless, there are Sikhs who do choose this path of not keeping their turban. There are prominent and valued Singaporeans who are Sikhs who have opted not to keep their turbans. 
// Many non-Sikh Singaporeans know too little about this wonderful community, but they see the visible differences between different Sikhs and may have questions about it. 
// Our game was designed as an attempt to educate, enrich, and engage all of these people. 
// The game offered both options to players (keep the turban, or not keep the turban), making it clear which is the one that is aligned with the faith before the decision, and showing the familial consequences of a choice that was not aligned with the faith. 
// In the reflections that players shared, none of the players came away with the impression that not keeping the turban was a convenient, light, or easy choice - the reflections that touched on this topic highlighted that they never knew how serious the issue was prior to the game.

// Unfortunately, the members of the community who objected to this option preferred a different approach altogether, while recognising our desire to encourage empathy and understanding for all members of a wonderful and diverse Sikh community. 
// We are in close consultation with the leaders of the Sikh community and will manage this delicate issue together. 

The purpose of this game is for us to gain empathy for people unlike ourselves, even though this may make us feel uncomfortable at times. 
At no point during the research, design, or development of the game and the story did we seek to undermine, judge, or challenge any belief system,  practice, or community. 
Our hope is to represent the lived experiences of real people, and to cherish them as human beings even if we disagree with their choices. 
It is difficult, but for Singapore to be better, we must learn to understand and accept these differences between people, even from within the same community. 

Aman Singh will be back soon. Thank you for your support and patience.

Regards,
The ToBeYou team

Sat Sri Akaal! (Sikh greeting: True is the Immortal one!)
I’m Amandeep Singh Sahota. I usually go by Aman (peaceful one).
Just like my sister’s name is Prabhjot (light of God), but we call her Jothi.
Tomorrow, I’m enlisting in NS. I’ll spend the next nine weeks rolling around in mud and sweat.
My friend Zhihao - we grew up as neighbours - has spent months telling me how horrible it’s going to be.
Because of the NS thing, Mum has been hovering over me a lot lately. I hope she’ll be okay...
What with me going into NS, and Jothi marrying her fiance Kirpal soon.
It’s not just her - even Papa-ji popped by my room unexpectedly the other night and said ‘Goodnight, son.’ 
And of course, my girlfriend Selinder has been very sweet to me. 
I know we’re both young, but I’m starting to think what Sel and I have is long-term. 
After NS, I’m off to university to study business administration.
Even though what I really want to do is…
Never mind. I can’t even say it yet.
Anyway, that’s me! Aman.
And this is what it’s like, to be me.

        (Laughs) You can’t fail, eh? #speaker_left
        
   - As for worrying about being the odd one out. You know it is not your first time being unique, and it will not be your last time. #speaker_left
   #speaker_left_image:cha_aman_mama_happy.png
    Remember - Nirbhau (without fear), Nirvair (without hate). Maintain your chardikala (serenity regardless of adversity.)  #speaker_left
    Just be yourself, and everything will fall into place. Because you are a good person. And a good son.  #speaker_left
    Yes, I’ll remember. #speaker_self
    I’ll be fine, mum. Don’t worry.   #speaker_self
    Alright, beta. #speaker_left
- Now, are you sure you have enough underwear? There’s more downstairs, just out of the laundry - #speaker_left

The next day, on Pulau Tekong.
Well, this is it. I’m on my own now.
I can’t believe it was just hours ago that Papa-ji and Mum brought me to the ferry terminal, and we took the boat here.
Turning in my NRIC for my 11B (military ID) felt like taking on a new life.
After we ate lunch in the cookhouse, we said our goodbyes. 
Thankfully Mum didn’t make a big deal about it. Papa-ji just patted me on the shoulder and gave a nod.
I miss Sel already. We only managed a few sweet messages and I-love-yous in the early morning hours. I wonder what she’s up to...

#speaker_right_image:cha_aman_lukman_curious.png
So I overheard just now - you don’t have to cut your hair? #speaker_right
No, for religious reasons. #speaker_self
Oh! But you can still have short hair and keep your turban, right? #speaker_right
No, hair is sacred in Sikhism, so underneath, my hair is long. I’ve literally never cut it. #speaker_self
Seriously? I had no idea. #speaker_right
So... all Sikhs keep their hair long? How about the girls? #speaker_right
Yes, the girls are supposed to keep their hair long as well. Uncut hair is called the ‘kesh’ and it’s one of the symbols of the faith we’re supposed to keep - we call it the five ‘K’s. #speaker_self
But I guess like in every religion, there are differences, based on personal reasons. So not everyone keeps it long, like my sister. #speaker_self
#speaker_right_image:cha_aman_lukman_normal.png
Oh, got it. Some Muslim men also believe they should keep facial hair, but I don’t. #speaker_right
Are you worried about maintaining it in NS? #speaker_right

The last week has been a blur.
We wake at dawn, we train, we fall into our bunks at night.
I manage to exchange a few messages with Sel most nights, before I sleep. It’s hard to talk much since I’m paranoid about running out of batt.

Ha! That was brilliant, dey. I was legit freaked out. #speaker_right
#background:bg_aman_bmtbunk.jpg
Well, that seems to have settled them. Glad they’re turning their attention to something else now. #inner_monologue
#speaker_left_image:cha_aman_lukman_curious.png
#speaker_left_name:Lukman
Wow, what was that about! #speaker_left
#speaker_left_image:cha_aman_lukman_normal.png
Didn’t know you can act so well, man! #speaker_left
When I saw you do that I was honestly shook. #speaker_left
Ha, thanks. I like acting. #speaker_self
I can tell bro. You’re super talented! #speaker_left
You shouldn’t have had to use it there though. Those guys were out of line. #speaker_left
Oh, that. #speaker_self
Yeah, I find that sometimes, humour is a useful way to just defuse the situation, when you don’t want to get into a fight. #speaker_self
I was pissed off, but it’s not like I want to start anything on an island in the middle of nowhere. #speaker_self
I’ve been teased about my turban since young, so all these - I guess you could call them coping mechanisms - are like second nature now. #speaker_self
Right. But then they’ll never learn, and they’ll think you’re fine with it. #speaker_left
That’s true… #inner_monologue
Maybe I shouldn’t have played along? #inner_monologue
They’d better not pull that crap again with me around, I tell you. Just because you’re a nice guy. They shouldn’t take advantage. #speaker_left

I’m really lucky to have a buddy. #inner_monologue
Hey, time to fold my turban to wear tomorrow. You want to help? #speaker_self
Can. Wait, let me remember what you said… fold in half first, right? #speaker_left
Yes, correct. #speaker_self
Then another half… yes, like that. #speaker_self
Then one third. #speaker_self
Now, hold tightly and I will fold towards you… #speaker_self
OK, done. Thanks! #speaker_self
Anytime, bro. #speaker_left
I’m really glad you have my back in here. #speaker_self
Don’t mention it. Anyway, you’ve had mine too. #speaker_left
I have? #speaker_self
Yes, of course. #speaker_left
With you around, I don’t have to be the only one in our section who eats in the Halal area of the cookhouse. You don’t have to eat Halal food, but you accompany me. #speaker_left
Well, it’s also because I’m not used to Chinese food... #inner_monologue
You’re always reminding me to hydrate when I push myself too hard. #speaker_left
That’s just normal decency, but okay... #inner_monologue
When I told you I wanted to try for OCS, you didn’t laugh or accuse me of trying to be wayang, but you said you thought I had potential. #speaker_left
But you do! #speaker_self
See? #speaker_left
I don’t want to tell the rest about the OCS thing, they’d make fun of me for trying. Plus, my grades are okay but they’re not that high. And people also say it’s harder to get into some positions as a Malay-Muslim. #speaker_left
Really? But I thought there are Malay fighter pilots and Generals? #speaker_self
Yeah, there are some. It’s just... rare. #speaker_left
To be fair, I think things are slowly getting better. At least now we can go on ships. #speaker_left
Huh? Why couldn’t you go before? #speaker_self
No Halal kitchens, supposedly. #speaker_left
#speaker_left_image:cha_aman_lukman_sad.png
But if you read comments about Muslims in the military online, it’s damn toxic. There are people who think we won’t be loyal to Singapore. #speaker_left
So is it about my diet, or is it about my loyalty?

+ [I'm sure there are reasons for this] It’s hard to understand, but I guess there must be reasons why some people came to think this way. #speaker_self
    Not saying they’re right at all, but mindsets take time to change. #speaker_self
    Maybe there’s a reason that makes sense to them generally. But it sucks because it makes no sense to me personally. #speaker_left
    This country means something to me. #speaker_left
    My ancestors were probably here before this place was called Singapore. #speaker_left
+ [Things should change faster] I’m sorry bro, things shouldn’t be this way.  #speaker_self
    Loyalty to Singapore isn’t about race or religion. Mindsets should move on. #speaker_self
    This kind of thing can only change slowly.  #speaker_left
    Then you see what generation you are born in, whether you are lucky or unlucky to suffer from this kind of mindset. #speaker_left
- But this is my struggle to fight la. No use complaining tonight.  #speaker_left

#speaker_left_image:cha_aman_lukman_normal.png
Eh for you how? You haven’t said what you want - command school or slack? #speaker_left
I haven’t decided yet. I mean, I’ll do what I can. #speaker_self
Still early days. How about after NS? #speaker_left
After? Er, I’m going into business school. #speaker_self
You don’t sound so happy about that. #speaker_left
Er, it’s okay lah. Honestly, if I could do something else, I might consider it. #speaker_self
Like what? #speaker_left

+ [Confide in him about your dream] I’ve actually been thinking about trying… acting? #speaker_self
    Whoa. Not bad huh, Aman Got Talent. #speaker_left
    Hurr. Not sure about talent, but I’ve always been in drama since young. #speaker_self
    I like acting. People say I’m good at it, and I like how I feel when I do it. #speaker_self
    How does it feel? #speaker_left
    It’s going to sound really weird and philosophical. #speaker_self
    Try me. #speaker_left
    So… acting is about pretending to be someone else, right? #speaker_self
    But when I act, I feel like I’m being me. #speaker_self
    Like I’m putting myself on the line.  #speaker_self
    The parts of me that feel the same emotions my character feels, think the same way my character thinks. #speaker_self
    In real life, we’re always presenting ourselves the way we want to be seen.  #speaker_self
    When I’m acting, it’s like... I’m revealing the way I am, and the way I am is… seen. #speaker_self
    Oh damn bro, that’s cheem.  #speaker_left
    (laughs) I know, right. #speaker_self
    
+ [Hesitate to share]
    Top secret. #speaker_self
    Wah lao, like that also can. #speaker_left
    What I would really want to do is act. #inner_monologue
    After NS, the plan is to go for some casting calls, maybe do some headshots and demo reels… #inner_monologue
    But I’m not ready to say all of that out loud. #inner_monologue
    Work in progress, akan datang (coming soon) bro. #speaker_self
    Okay man, keep me posted. #speaker_left

- Crap, we talked until so late. Time to crash. (Yawns) #speaker_self
You’re right. Goodnight! Let’s slay it tomorrow. #speaker_left
Finally, blessed sleep… #inner_monologue
Wait, what am I forgetting… #inner_monologue
Oh right! Sel! #inner_monologue
Quick, turn on my phone. I can only spend 10 minutes max. #inner_monologue

It was good bb, how about yours? #speaker_self
Hey there you are!! 😍 #speaker_1
Mine was OK, still waiting to hear back on jobs  #speaker_1
There’s one accounting position that looks possible #speaker_1
And a couple of grant admin jobs in govt agencies #speaker_1
You’re gonna be a career woman huh, way ahead of me… #speaker_self
Don’t be silly jaan. Well, maybe at first #speaker_1
But you are going to university remember, and doing business #speaker_1
So you will be the big dollars man. 🤪 #speaker_1

    🤣🤣 #speaker_1
    I’m not sure I want that life though #speaker_1
    I definitely want to work. At least for now #speaker_1
    But it will also be nice to live a quiet life #speaker_1
    Meditate. Gardening. Take care of kids #speaker_1
    Every day go to langgar hall (Sikh communal kitchens, in gurdwaras) and volunteer #speaker_1
    Prep food for worshippers, the needy… #speaker_1

    Do you have some life goals I don’t know about? #speaker_1
