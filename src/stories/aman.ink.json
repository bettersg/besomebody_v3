Thousands of you have played it and shared such thoughtful and heart-felt responses to the game thus far.","\n","^We have only released the initial chapters of two characters, and there’s much more to their stories, and many more characters on the way. I am excited for you to play them and to feel empathy for their journeys too.","\n","^However, there are some in the Sikh community who felt that the way in which one of our characters, Aman Singh, was presented was not respectful. They have given strong feedback to us and requested that we consider changing key parts of the story.","\n","^We hear their concerns, and are in close consultation with the leaders of that community to address the issues. Allow us to also explain the philosophy behind the game and the way in which our stories are written.","\n","^ToBeYou's purpose is to share the experiences of different groups of Singaporeans, including the different experiences of people within a particular group.","\n","^We hope that through exploring powerful identity dilemmas,  users will appreciate the complexity behind the choices others make, and engender empathy and goodwill for those around them.","\n","^Firstly, our stories are written after substantial research. We do open source reading, we have an academic Research Advisor, and we hold multiple focus group discussions with members of the community.","\n","^Our writers and editors are also closely connected to the community, and most are from those communities themselves.","\n","^We do not put any value judgement on the choices that real people make, and we try to represent their dilemmas in our stories.","\n","^Secondly, our game is designed to explore different pathways that a person from that group may take. There are deliberately no right or wrong answers, no winning or losing outcomes, as in life.","\n","^The pathways are deliberately designed to allow players to explore a variety of choices that shape the character, and mirror the diversity we see even within a community group.","\n","^We do not favour or promote one pathway over the other.","\n","^The choices that players make early in the game have consequences that will be played out in later chapters, and this is an important element of the story. Some of the choices that the character makes in the early chapters will have real and serious consequences later on.","\n","^The objective of this is to let players experience those dilemmas first hand, and in the process, gain empathy for people who have a different identity, or have chosen pathways different from theirs.","\n","^The purpose of this game is for us to gain empathy for people unlike ourselves, even though this may make us feel uncomfortable at times.","\n","^At no point during the research, design, or development of the game and the story did we seek to undermine, judge, or challenge any belief system,  practice, or community.","\n","^Our hope is to represent the lived experiences of real people, and to cherish them as human beings even if we disagree with their choices.","\n","^It is difficult, but for Singapore to be better, we must learn to understand and accept these differences between people, even from within the same community.","\n","^Aman Singh will be back soon. Thank you for your support and patience.","\n","^Regards,","\n","^The ToBeYou team","\n","^RETURN TO MAIN MENU","\n",{"->":"aman_1_intro"},{"#f":1}],"aman_1_intro":[{"#":"knot:aman_1_intro"},{"#":"ui:narrator"},{"#":"background:bg_aman_intro.jpg"},{"#":"music:aman_intro.mp3"},"^Aman Singh ",{"#":"title"},"\n","ev",2,"/ev",{"VAR=":"character_id","re":true},"ev",1,"/ev",{"VAR=":"chapter_id","re":true},"^Sat Sri Akaal!
