Appa left early in the morning... and didn't come back.","\n","^He left us that day and he’s been uncontactable since. We called and called, but he never picked up.","\n","^Sometimes I think he wanted to be like the airplanes he worked on, free to roam the skies, to go anywhere they pleased. But I might never find out.","\n","^Sounds dramatic, but that's my story.","\n","^Since then, Amma, Revati and I have had to fend for ourselves.","\n","^It’s not been easy, especially for Amma. She works a 12-hour shift everyday as a sales assistant at the department store.","\n","^Revati is doing her A levels, and she’s done part-time jobs too.","\n","^My dream is to make it a little easier for them. If I can fulfill mine, I would be helping theirs too.","\n","^But first, I have grades to keep up, an internship to find, and then hopefully, a job!
