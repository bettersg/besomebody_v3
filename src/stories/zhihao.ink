Eh, hi. I'm Zhihao.
I dunno what to say about myself cos my life not very interesting, lol.
I’m 18, I go to the same JC as Gavin. At first I wanted poly cos got all the chiobus there, and Aman is there also. 
Me and Aman stay on the same floor since P1. The whole floor only got both of us same age, so bo pian lor-- like or don’t like end up only can disturb each other, haha.
Anyway, end up I go JC. Pa always wanted that for me cos then I got better chance to go uni.
Two years ago, he passed away. The whole kampung came: His friends, his colleagues, his ex boss current boss all came to the wake. All say he was a damn solid guy. A star worker.
They won’t get Pa this type of person again. 
But Pa always used to tell me, be your own boss is best. 
So I started my own business. I do game streaming on Twitch, now got almost 1K viewers. Tipping page all I also have. I set up on StreamXclusive, so when my viewers are happy they donate. 
Guess what. Lots of them are happy. Hah. The money is good and getting better and better. 
Last month right, I diam-diam pay off all the bills, buy the groceries for dinner – yah, I know how to choose these things, okay. The kailan, the sotong, all I pick sibeh fresh one. Ma got a shock, hah!
Swee, man. It’s not much lah but you go ask my friends -- see if any of them can pay their house bills.  
It’s really not hard. The house only got me and Ma. Every night she will light one joss stick for Pa. And every night, I work on my business.
So that’s my life lor. I’m Zhihao.
And this is what it's like, to be me.

Cannot! I really cannot! #speaker_left
//Back and forth of MOTHER’S and JI GU’s faces [make it clear that they are talking to each other]. The following conversation takes place in full Hokkien, translated into standard English. 
Didn’t you just say you don’t want to rent out your place? That means you have one extra room. Why Ah Gong cannot stay with you? #speaker_right
Do we need to discuss this now? #speaker_left
Let’s not run away from the problem. #speaker_right
The old folks’ home just restructured their fees and the subsidy brackets this month. I’ve always been very straight with you: $400 is the most I can afford. My brother can only give $200. #speaker_right
You’re telling me now you can afford the extra $450 to keep Ba there? #speaker_right
Wtf, Ah Gong’s home fees increase so much? Why Ma always never tell me this kind of thing? #inner_monologue
I cannot say out loud, but I really dunno how it’s fair that Ah Gong is still here when his soul is long gone. Zero dignity. #inner_monologue
I can’t remember when Ah Gong stopped talking. But I remember our last convo. #inner_monologue
He thought I stole his comb so he threw his cup at me. His baby sip-cup. Then he screamed and called me CB. And then he cried and cried and cried. #inner_monologue
He cannot talk anymore. He cannot walk anymore. He cannot eat anymore. He should have died long ago. #inner_monologue
I wish he died and not Pa. #inner_monologue
I wish it so much. #inner_monologue
Why can’t Ba stay with you? You stay by yourself, you have three rooms. #speaker_left
I have to travel to JB every two weeks for work, how’d you expect me to care for Ah Gong? ##speaker_right
We can all chip in for a maid – #speaker_left
Siao ah! How is a maid trained to treat his bedsores, give him his insulin shots? And you think they’re okay with changing his diapers? Even the nurses complain he always fights them off and scratches them. #speaker_right
Remember what I said about trust. Don’t ever trust maids to be left alone with  Ah Gong. #speaker_right
I’m so busy already juggling a job and a kid. You know it. #speaker_left
Kid? Wah lao eh, Ma. #inner_monologue
{ zhihao_1_earning: 
    - 1:  Then what? You want your son to chip in too? He’s still in school! #speaker_right
        Don’t forget, you have to declare your son’s income if you want him to help. #speaker_right
        If it goes over the income cap, we lose our subsidy.#speaker_right
    - 2: Your son just said he isn’t earning a stable income. And he’s still a student. How is it fair on him to shoulder the fees? #speaker_right
        Stupid. Why did I go bluff him about my income.  #inner_monologue
    - else: Your son said he isn’t even earning yet. You want him to stop focusing on his studies to look for a job? That’s selfish to the boy right?  #speaker_right
        Stupid. Why did I go bluff him about my income. #inner_monologue
}
I’ll think of something. Don’t bring my son into this.   #speaker_left
$450 per month. Doable lah. #inner_monologue
It’s doable for me if I go pro. I'm almost good enough already. #inner_monologue

When I’m not streaming, I'm playing every night. I play this first-person shooter game called Alphas.
It's a multiplayer game so I team up with other players. Also got high-skill ceiling so I don’t have limits on improving.
Last time I always play with Gavin and Aman. Gavin I met on Discord first, then we found out we’re from the same JC. After that right, we always eat bak chor mee (minced pork noodles) together when we share tutorial break. He eat so much until his IGN (in-game name) also become ‘bakchormee’, lol.
Now I can’t remember how long ago all of us played together.
They're busy lah.
But if you don't ask then you also don’t know right?
